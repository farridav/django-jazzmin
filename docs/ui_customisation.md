# UI Tweaks

There are various things you can do to change the look and feel of your admin when using jazzmin, some are structural
changes

## UI Customizer

Jazzmin has a built in UI configurator, mimicked + enhanced from [adminlte demo](https://adminlte.io/themes/v3/index3.html),
that allows you to customise parts of the interface interactively.

To enable this, set `JAZZMIN_SETTINGS["show_ui_builder"] = True` and there will be an icon in the top right of the screen
that allows you to customise the interface.

When your happy with your customisations, press the "Show Code" button, and it will give you a code snippet to put
into your settings that will persist these customisations beyond page refresh.

## Themes

With the ui customiser enabled (see above), you can try out different bootswatch themes, and combine the theme with our
other UI tweaks.

### Dark mode enabled

If you set `JAZZMIN_UI_TWEAKS["dark_mode_theme"]` to a dark theme, then users that have opted for dark mode on their
device will be served this theme instead of the one in `JAZZMIN_UI_TWEAKS["theme"]`

This is done using `prefers-color-scheme` in the CSS media attribute, see [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme)
for more information on the web standard

for example, to use `flatly` for all users that have no preference or prefer light mode, and `darkly` for those who opt
for dark mode on their device:

```python
JAZZMIN_UI_TWEAKS = {
    ...
    "theme": "flatly",
    "dark_mode_theme": "darkly",
}
```

To force the use of a single theme regardless, just omit `dark_mode_theme` from your `JAZZMIN_UI_TWEAKS`

You can preview any of the available themes on your site using the UI Customizer (See above), or view them on bootswatch

## DIY with custom CSS/JS

If there are things you need to do with CSS/JS, but want to avoid overriding the templates yourself, you can include a
custom CSS and/or JS file, just pass a relative path to your files e.g:

```python
"custom_css": "common/css/main.css",
"custom_js": "common/js/main.js"
```

Into your jazzmin settings (Ensure these files can be found by the static file finder)

If you want to manually tweak CSS styles for a particular theme, you can start your CSS rule with
`body.theme-<themename>` e.g:

```css
body.theme-darkly p {
    color: pink;
}
```

Or to target your `dark_mode_theme` wrap it like this:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
    body.theme-darkly p {
        color: pink;
    }
}
```
